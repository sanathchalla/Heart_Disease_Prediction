# SanathChandraChalla_Lab3_Python-for-DS

Project Description:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting heart disease occurrence based on various factors. It encompasses exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and the implementation and evaluation of different classification algorithms. The objective is to use machine learning to detect patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease, contributing to healthcare by aiding early detection and prevention strategies. The project covers supervised learning using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. Ensemble methods will also be explored to enhance model performance. Model evaluation will ensure accuracy, enabling healthcare professionals to identify individuals at risk and reduce the impact of heart disease.
